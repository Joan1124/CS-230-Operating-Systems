In this project my client, the Gaming Room, wants to develop a web-based application for their game "draw it or lose it". Something I did very well in this project was identifying the design constraints in the software requirements. Having a design document made the coding way easier, because I had a guideline of what I needed to accomplish and could check it out at anyt time.

If I was to improve any area of the document, I would improve the evaluation part of the document and add more concise insights about every operating system. It is highly important to interpret the user needs accurately because a bad interpretation could lead to a faulty or incomplete software, or even a completely fine software but ultimately not what the user needed. 

In the future I will use all the techniques I learned in this course such as creating a design document, and identifying the operating system for a certain application.
